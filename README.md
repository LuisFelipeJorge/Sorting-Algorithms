# Sorting Algorithms

As I am an undergraduate student in computer science, I see it as a great opportunity to learn more and also know how to use the git and github tools, share what I learned in my classes, the codes I am implementing and do this with my personal comments to show my way of thinking and how I understand the problems. I did a course called "Introduction to Computer Science", where I was introduced to some data structures, like arrays and also some methods to classify their elements.

## A note:
I had already made repositories for each sorting algorithm here, but I believe that it is cleaner to organize things in just one big project; therefore, I copied the final codes in a new folder and created a new repository where everything was integrated and i delete the olders folder so don't get confused with the commit dates.
